# Everyday App

![Made with Love in India](https://madewithlove.org.in/badge.svg)

## Target Problem

We all know the humanity comprises of 50% of the fairer sex. But the same is facing some issues which either they are not very well aware of or even if they are they don't know the way out. And that problem is domestic violence.
As a good Samaritans, you have to make an app, 

* Which let females know about what domestic violence is
* Rules and regulations which can safeguard their interest
* Some emergency buttons which can ask for quick help from the police/family members in case of dangers (in terms of chat or call 100)

## Basic Idea

We selected this problem as this has been a long silent issue. However, we all are aware of it and don't take any action. We also believe that women deserve equal respect.

To tackle the problem selected we made an app that provides these features: 

1) Our app is disguised as any other normal app(that's why it's named as the everyday app).

2) We provided sections of daily articles and community posts so that women can see other women and become aware of the violence they are facing. 

3) We also provided educational content through our app so that women can be sure if they are facing violence and if they are then how to report it.

4) We also gave a chat with the community section whereby the women can talk and discuss their issues with other women.

5) Nearby Shelters: The women can find temporary shelters if the situation is too bad.

6) On the home screen we gave a call button so that the call can be made without any delay in case of emergency.
